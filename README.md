This project analyzes hotel booking data to identify patterns and key factors influencing customer cancellations. The goal is to transform raw booking data into actionable insights that can help hotels reduce cancellation rates and improve revenue planning.

📊 Project Objective

To explore booking behavior and build an interactive dashboard that highlights trends in cancellations across customer types, booking timelines, and room categories.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
MS Excel – Data cleaning and dashboard creation

Analyzed cancellation patterns based on:
Lead time (days between booking and arrival)
Hotel type (City vs Resort)
Customer type
Room category and pricing
Calculated cancellation rates and booking trends using pivot tables and aggregated metrics
